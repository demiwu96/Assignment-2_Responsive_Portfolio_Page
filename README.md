# Assignment-2_Responsive_Portfolio_Page

## Description
This website is built with HTML, SSC, javaScript and bootstrap. The purpose of the project is to become familiar with bootstrap and build a responsive website that will fit on various sizes of screens. Portfolio page is important, because it is a way of showing your style, projects you have done and your special experiences. People can read the website to know more about you.

The website has a navbar that links to different pages:

**[Index](index.html)** is where you can find information about me.

**[Portfolio](Portfolio.html)** is where I put all my projects.

**[Contact](contact.html)** is where you can send me an email and your message.
